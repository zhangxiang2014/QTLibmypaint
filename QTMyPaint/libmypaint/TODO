== MyPaint 1.2 ==
- Implement support for "foreign" buffers in GeglSurface backend,
  that is buffers which are provided though set_buffer() and may
  not always have the ideal color format and tile size.

- Make sure copyright headers exists in all files
- Document the library concepts and API in the code. Import information from wiki
- Set up build of documentation. Import diagrams from doc/

- Document how install, lookup and modification of brush resources should happen
- Make sure all resources are installed to "libmypaint" (not "mypaint")

- Implement save/serialization of brushes to JSON
- Use the libmypaint load/save methods in MyPaint itself

- Allow to build minimal build with just a Makefile
  Check in the generated headers on changes to avoid Python dependency.
  Make json-c dependency opt-in.
  Maybe include a "mypaint.c" file, which can be used to just drop code into project?

- Tests and benchmarks suite.
 * Implement checks for correctness of rendering
 * Benchmarks should output the results as JSON



== Later ==
- Use floats types instead of uint15/uint16
- Define that surfaces are in linear-light, not gamma-corrected.
 * Update shipped brushes to be adjusted for this.
 * Bump the brush version or otherwise annotate this change so that
   other applications can handle them?
